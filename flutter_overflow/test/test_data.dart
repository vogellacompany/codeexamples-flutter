          "I&#39;ve been always using arrays whose size are asked in the input by the user like: &lt;br/&gt; \r\n```\r\nint main(){\r\n    int n;\r\n    cin&gt;&gt;n;\r\n    int arr[n];\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI never faced any problem with this method but now I&#39;ve read a lot of articles saying that this syntax is not supported by C++ as C++ needs array size at compile time or arrays must be made dynamically using `new` keyword. Could anybody make this clear if the above code: &lt;br/&gt;\r\n1. Is supported by new compilers and not by the old compilers. If yes, then after which version this syntax is supported?\r\n2. Allocates the array dynamically in Heap or is this static memory allocation in stack?\r\n",
