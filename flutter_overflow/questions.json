It means it goes to another page. But I want it not to o to another page after submitting, It should stay on the same page. I don't know what i am doing wrong. I googled a lot, I found a lot of answers but all of them were doing this that \"After submitting, it goes to another page\" But I want it to stay on the same page.

One of the things that GDB does is to set a breakpoint at the symbol `_dl_debug_state` located in the dynamic loader.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ readelf -sW /nix/store/jx19wa4xlh9n4324xdl9rjnykd19mmq3-glibc-2.30/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 | grep _dl_debug_state\r\n    24: 000000000000f590     1 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   12 _dl_debug_state@@GLIBC_PRIVATE\r\n   379: 000000000000f590     1 FUNC    LOCAL  DEFAULT   12 __GI__dl_debug_state\r\n   460: 000000000000f590     1 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   12 _dl_debug_state\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like the address of `_dl_debug_state` within the shared object is `0x000000000000f590`. However, for my particular application, GDB determines that the address is `0x00007ffff7fe3590`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(gdb) info symbol 0x00007ffff7fe3590\r\n_dl_debug_state in section .text of target:/nix/store/jx19wa4xlh9n4324xdl9rjnykd19mmq3-glibc-2.30/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm struggling to work out how GDB has come to this conclusion.

To identify which object to select, I only have access to one field (the name field), but that field is not the primary key. this is an issue because the django ways that I know only seem to work with the pk. In addition, I cannot modify the structure of the model because it messes up tenantmixin.\r\n\r\nhere is the model:\r\n```\r\nclass Client(TenantMixin):\r\n\r\n    id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)\r\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, default='')\r\n    email = models.EmailField(default='')\r\n    username = models.CharField(max_length=100, default='') ###### username\r\n    password = models.CharField(max_length=100, default='')\r\n    created_on = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)\r\n    auto_drop_schema = True\r\n```\r\nand in the form I proceed as:\r\n```\r\nfield_name = 'email'\r\nobj = Client.objects.get(name= dbschema)\r\nfield_object = Client._meta.get_field(field_name)\r\nfield_value = field_object.value_from_object(obj)\r\n```\r\nthe issue is in the line:\r\n```\r\nobj = Client.objects.get(name= dbschema)\r\n```\r\nbecause it should be the primary that is the parameter inside the get() function. I cannot find a way to modify this statement to access the right object from the model. How could I tweak this to let me find the proper object from the name field?

I confess that I am not an experienced django developper but I have done as much work on my own as possible, as well as explaining the issue the best way I could.
